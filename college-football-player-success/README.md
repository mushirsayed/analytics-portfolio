# Project: Predicting NFL Success from College Football Performance

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how high school recruiting ratings and college performance metrics translate into early NFL career success for quarterbacks and running backs. The analysis focuses on identifying which college production and efficiency measures most strongly predict professional outcomes.

## Business Problem
How accurately do college production metrics predict early NFL career success for quarterbacks and running backs?

## Approach
- Integrated datasets from Sports Reference, 247Sports, NFL Combine, and Pro Football Reference  
- Cleaned and engineered performance, efficiency, and athletic metrics  
- Built Python models in Jupyter to analyze predictors of NFL success  
- Visualized trends across player cohorts  

## Tools
Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome
Delivered a scalable analytics framework demonstrating how college efficiency and production frequently outweigh recruiting rank when predicting professional performance.
